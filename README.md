## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Framework de CSS


### What I learned

In this project, I reinforced key concepts such as:

- 🎨 Using `mix-blend-mode` to apply color effects over images.
- 📱 Implementing `<picture>` and `<source>` elements to optimize images based on screen size.
- 🧩 Organizing components with **TailwindCSS** while maintaining a clean and scalable workflow.


### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to:

- Deepen my understanding of TailwindCSS with custom configurations
- Improve accessibility of interactive components
- Implement more complex animations with CSS


### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Helped me better understand utility classes and their implementation.


### AI Collaboration

Describe how you used AI tools (if any) during this project. This helps demonstrate your ability to work effectively with AI assistants.

- What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot)?
- How did you use them (e.g., debugging, generating boilerplate, brainstorming solutions)?
- What worked well? What didn't?
